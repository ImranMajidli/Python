#  Pig Latin is a silly made-up language that alters English words. If a word begins with a vowel, the word yay is
# added to the end of it. If a word begins with a consonant or consonant cluster (like ch or gr), that consonant
# or cluster is moved to the end of the word followed by ay.

# My name is AL SWEIGART and I am 4,000 years old.
# Ymay amenay isyay ALYAY EIGARTSWAY andyay Iyay amyay 4,000 yearsyay oldyay
